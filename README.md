### Parse HL7 ORU message output from PowerScribe360
Running coreparser.py parses the HL7sample.text (HL7 V2.3) and outputs the parsed file in .pdf format as a report that can be faxed out to referring provider.I have included the test file used for parsing ("HL7Sample.text") and the output file ("report.pdf")
